### 👋🏼 About Me
---

Hello World, I’m Andrew Almeida! Pleasure to meet you 💫

I’m currently learning full stack web development at LearningFuze and it's been such a challenging, yet fun, and fulfilling experience. Learning how to create full-stack apps is such a powerful tool to have. My goal is to continue learning and to bring to fruition, apps of community building.

When I'm not learning and practicing code, I'm climbing! 🧗🏽

  My first full stack app is based around this activity... please take a look! ⚡️
  
I’m looking to collaborate on any and everything!! 👨🏼‍💻
