### 👋🏼 About Me
---

Hello World, I’m Andrew Almeida! Pleasure to meet you 💫

I’m currently a Web Designer at With. Company where we crowdsource community aid!

 # withaid.org <--- here is a website I made using Webflow

My goal is to continue learning and to bring to fruition, apps of community building.

Giving back and helping in any way is a life goal of mine.

I'm a firm believer in Atomic Habits and how consistency, however small, can lead to exponential gains.
  
I’m looking to collaborate on any and everything!! 👨🏼‍💻
